Notes for Eagle 5 development

1. declspec

fix class and global function declarations to use declspec or whatever on MSVC for DLLs
so make a
#ifdef MSVC && DLL_BUILD
   #define EAGLE_DECLSPEC __declspec__
#else
   #define EAGLE_DECLSPEC
#endif

somewhere....


2?. Widgets going out of scope before their Layouts / WidgetHandlers - can't call functions on their pointers in destructo code



3. Create a widget factory that tracks widgets and frees them so the gui and layouts don't have to?

4. Widgets needed

a - Drop down list
b - Radio Button
c - Menu, MenuItem, MenuBar
d - ButtonBar?
e - Scroll bars
