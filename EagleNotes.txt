Notes for Eagle 5 development

1. declspec

fix class and global function declarations to use declspec or whatever on MSVC for DLLs
so make a
#ifdef MSVC && DLL_BUILD
   #define EAGLE_DECLSPEC __declspec__
#else
   #define EAGLE_DECLSPEC
#endif

somewhere....


2. Asynchronous timers? Can I implement an OnTick function for EagleTimer??????

3. Widgets going out of scope before their Layouts / WidgetHandlers - can't call functions on their pointers in destructo code
