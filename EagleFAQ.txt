Edgar's Agile Gui Library and Extensions Frequently Asked Questions

EAGLE FAQ :

1. Why doesn't anything show up?
   A1. Have you set an area for your WidgetHandler? If not, it will assume the default size, which is 0x0.
         Setting the area of the WidgetHandler also sets the area of it's root layout, which will determine your scene layout.
   A2. Have you called EagleGraphicsContext::FlipDisplay() after drawing your scene? If not, it won't show up.
   A3. Are you using a DumbLayout? DumbLayout's are dumb. They don't do anything with the area or position of the widgets
         that they hold. If you haven't given their widgets a position and area, they will default to 0x0 at 0,0.

2. My decorated class widgets are all screwed up when I add them to a layout. Why?
   A1. You need to add the outermost decoration of the widget to the layout, not the widget itself. A GUI is smart enough to add
         the most decorated layer of the widget, but not a Layout. This is by design. Sometimes you want to add a widget that is decorated
         to a layout without tracking the decoration itself. This is useful for decorator widgets to have their own inner layouts
         for a widget. When adding Decorated widgets to a layout, use Widget->GetDecoratorRoot() instead of Widget. GUIs will take
         care of this for you, as you don't add Decorator sub components to a GUI.
         
3. My code works in debug mode, but not release mode. What did I do wrong?
   A1. Check carefully for EAGLE_DEBUG and EAGLE_ASSERT statements. They will only run when DEBUG is defined.
   A2. This means that if you call your bool Init() function inside an EAGLE_ASSERT, it won't call Init() in release mode!
