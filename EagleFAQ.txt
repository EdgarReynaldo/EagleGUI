Edgar's Agile Gui Library and Extensions Frequently Asked Questions


1. Why doesn't anything show up?
   A1. Have you set an area for your WidgetHandler? If not, it will assume the default size, which is 0x0.
         Setting the area of the WidgetHandler also sets the area of it's root layout, which will determine your scene layout.
   A2. Have you called EagleGraphicsContext::FlipDisplay() after drawing your scene? If not, it won't show up.
   A3. Are you using a DumbLayout? DumbLayout's are dumb. They don't do anything with the area or position of the widgets
         that they hold. If you haven't given them a position and area, they will default to 0x0 at 0,0.
