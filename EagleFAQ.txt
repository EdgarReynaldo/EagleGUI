Edgar's Agile Gui Library and Extensions Frequently Asked Questions

EAGLE FAQ :

1. Why doesn't anything show up?
   A1. Have you set an area for your WidgetHandler? If not, it will assume the default size, which is 0x0.
         Setting the area of the WidgetHandler also sets the area of it's root layout, which will determine your scene layout.
   A2. Have you called EagleGraphicsContext::FlipDisplay() after drawing your scene? If not, it won't show up.
   A3. Are you using a DumbLayout? DumbLayout's are dumb. They don't do anything with the area or position of the widgets
         that they hold. If you haven't given their widgets a position and area, they will default to 0x0 at 0,0.
         
2. My code works in debug mode, but not release mode. What did I do wrong?
   A1. Check carefully for EAGLE_DEBUG and EAGLE_ASSERT statements. They will only run when DEBUG is defined.
   A2. This means that if you call your bool Init() function inside an EAGLE_ASSERT, it won't call Init() in release mode!

3. My app / game crashes on exit. What's up?
   A1. If you have GUI objects like a WidgetHandler, they often have resources like images. If you shutdown eagle, all images
       are destroyed when their window is destroyed when the window manager closes when eagle is shutdown. This means the GUIs images
       have already been destroyed when they try to free them.

4. I get input events, but state based input doesn't work - for example if (input_mouse_press(LMB)) {...} never returns true???
   A1. You're not updating the input handler. This can be fixed in the following ways.
   A2. Instead of taking events directly from the system queue, use EagleSystem::WaitForSystemEventAndUpdateState instead. It
       waits for an event and updates the input handler for you.
   A3. Use EagleSystem::GetSystemInput()->HandleInputEvent(EagleEvent ev). This will update the system input state machine.

5. My animation isn't working. I don't get any timer events.
   A1. You need to start the system timer before it will tick. sys->GetSystemTimer()->Start(); will do it.
   A2. Are you passing the timer event to your GUI? You can also call GUI::Update(sys->GetSystemTimer()->SPT()) or whatever
       else you need.
