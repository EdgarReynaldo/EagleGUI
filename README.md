    Copyright 2009-2025+ by Edgar Reynaldo

    See LICENSE in the root directory for allowed uses of this library.

Eagle now builds with CMake. Build is working on Windows with MinGW and on Linux with GCC.

There are several tutorial and example programs that come with the binaries or build with the library.

You can find beginner tutorials on how to use the library on the wiki at

Follow the guide on the right to see available wiki pages.

CHM Docs come with the binaries. HTML Docs can be built using the supplied doxyfile and Doxygen. But
beware there can be quite a few web docs.
