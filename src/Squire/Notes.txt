Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to act as a Secret Santa and create a game for Arthur Kalliokoski. The game should be suitable for playing on a low end Linux machine, and implement at least one of the following ideas:

    Player can take damage, but can offset damage with 12 oz. cans of life giving elixir, as in Duke Nukem.
    Gravity is important (damage based on height of fall, difficulty of jumps).
    Selectable difficulty settings. This could be changing the amount of health items available,
    or changing gravitational strength.

Development

You have until 12/23/2012 to develop this game. Review the rules if necessary, then get to work!
