Notes for Eagle 5 development

Issues
-99 Threading Issues with Multiple Windows - debug this shit
    Step 1. Create a separate log for threading only
    Step 2. Give mutexes and threads a name - this may already be done if they are EagleObjects
    Step 3. Log TryLock,Lock,and Unlock
    Step 4. Eg. ThreadLog() << "[Try][Un]Locking mutex m on thread t"
    Step 5. Keep a log of which mutexes are locked and how many there are


-5. BasicText::ShrinkWrap needs some work? Margins are super large for large text. Not sure why.

-4. WidgetHandler should be able to draw without a buffer. Separate buffer out.

-3. Layouts should all use AdjustWidgetArea in RequestWidgetRectangle. This is not the case yet.

0. Building with MSVC

1. EAGLE_LINK_TYPE (necessary for 0)

fix class and global function declarations to use declspec or whatever on MSVC for DLLs
so make a
#ifdef MSVC && DLL_BUILD
   #define EAGLE_DECLSPEC __declspec__
#else
   #define EAGLE_DECLSPEC
#endif

somewhere....


2. Widgets going out of scope before their Layouts / WidgetHandlers - can't call functions on their pointers in destructo code
 - Need to test differing destruction orders of widgets and layouts and widgethandlers


3. Create a widget factory that tracks widgets and frees them so the gui and layouts don't have to?
 - Mostly complete
 - Layouts no longer manage widget memory. Don't know what I was thinking with that one.

TODO : Milestones necessary for development

0. namespace EAGLE

1. Finish basic widget set

      
   TODO : Widgets in production
      a - Menu, MenuItem, MenuBar
      b - WrapText
      c - Dial, Tooltip
      d - GuiWindow
      e - ZoomCamera (might want ScrollArea first)

      
   COMPLETE : 
      A - BasicButton , GuiButton , IconButton , RadioGroup
      B - BasicText , SelectText , LinkText , EditText
      C - BasicTextButton
      D - DropDownList
      E - ScrollButton , Scroller, ScrollBar, ScrollView , ScrollArea
      F - Slider , Slider2D
      G - Camera
      H - DumbLayout , GridLayout , ClassicMenuLayout , ListBox , RelativeLayout , SplitterLayouts , PinLayout , NPLayout
      I - FlowLayout, HBoxLayout, VBoxLayout

2. Features
   TODO : Make the file system useful for creating files and checking if they exist
   TODO : WidgetFactory
   TODO : scripting

3. Create documentation - doxygen looks best for this
- WIP
- Fix 'module' problem
- Maintenance
- Fix InputHandler.cpp and InputHandler.hpp (@fn references)

4. Make the library work with MSVC (Not looking forward to this)
   A - DECLSPEC DLLEXPORT necessary for MSVC when building without .def files
   
5. Build system
          A - CodeBlocks projects are nice for me, but they're not fully portable
Complete *B - CMake
          C - Premake http://premake.github.io/ (looks like it is under active development, with new features, and lots of compiler support)
          D - Autotools? You're kidding right?

6- Backend support
   A - SDL 2.0
   B - SFML
X  C - Allegro 5
   D - Allegro 4

7. Platform support - already mostly possible due to Allegro's multi platform support
X  A. Windows and Linux supported through gcc and mingw.
   B. OSX
   C. Android
   D. iOS
